## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ 100% Offline & Secure
* **No Internet Required:** Works completely without data.
* **Privacy First:** All data is stored locally on your device (LocalStorage). No data is ever sent to a cloud server.
* **Backup & Restore:** Easily save your school data to a file (`.json`) and restore it on any device.

### 🧮 Dynamic Weightage Engine (New!)
* **Flexible Logic:** Unlike old apps with hardcoded math, v2.0 allows you to configure **Full Marks** and **Weightage %** in Settings.
* **NEP 2020 Ready:** If the Govt changes Project marks from 10 to 20 next year, you just update the Settings. No coding required.
* **Rounding Policy:** Uses `Math.ceil()` (Successor Rounding) to benefit students (e.g., 23.1 becomes 24).

### 📄 Professional Reporting (Print Ready)
* **Vertical Merge Layout:** The Grand Total and Percentage columns span vertically across all subjects for a clear, readable summary.
* **Official Styling:** Headers (School Name, UDISE) use **Times New Roman (Bold, Black)** to look like official registers.
* **Odia Translations:**
    * Assignment → **ଲିଖିତ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟ**
    * Project → **ପ୍ରକଳ୍ପ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟ**
    * Grand Total → **ସର୍ବମୋଟ ପ୍ରାପ୍ତାଙ୍କ**

### 📱 Optimized User Experience
* **AMOLED Dark Mode:** Pure Black (`#000000`) interface for battery saving and high contrast.
* **Smart Save:** Warns you if marks are missing/empty before saving (prevents "Ghost Completion").
* **Input Guards:** Prevents typing marks higher than the exam limit (e.g., typing 26 in a 25-mark exam).
