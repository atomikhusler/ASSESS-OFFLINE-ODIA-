- **Rounding:** All fractional marks are rounded **UP** using `Math.ceil()`.
- **Weightage:** Fully customizable via `Settings` > `Group B`.
  - *Default:* T1 (30%), Written (10%), Project (20%), Annual (40%).

### **Smart Export**
- **Dynamic Naming:** PDFs are automatically saved as:
  `Class [X] [Session] Mark Register [UDISE].pdf`
- **Excel Support:** Exports `.xls` files with **UTF-8 BOM** encoding to correctly display **Odia (ଓଡ଼ିଆ)** and other regional languages.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

For developers and auditors reviewing the source:

* **Sanity Loops:** The `restoreData()` function runs a pre-flight check to ensure all Class Arrays (`1-8`) exist before committing data to memory.
* **Defensive DOM:** Helper functions like `setVal` wrap DOM interactions in `try...catch` blocks to prevent crashes on older WebViews.
* **Scalability:** The codebase uses `const MAX_CLS = 8`, making it trivial to upgrade the app to support Class 9 or 10 in a single line change.

# 📜 Changelog

## [v6.0] — Elite Edition (2026-03-19)

### 🚀 Core Engine Upgrades
* **Government-Compliant Math**: Integrated a strict **Ceiling Engine** (`Math.ceil`) to ensure all weightage percentages round up to the next whole number per official guidelines.
* **Numeral-Only Sanitization**: Locked input fields to digits `0-9` only, instantly stripping decimals and non-numeric characters for cleaner data entry.
* **Subject-Wise Evaluation**: Re-engineered the result logic to provide **Per-Subject Pass/Fail** status based on the $\ge 30\%$ threshold.

### 📄 Document Architecture (PDF & Excel)
* **3-Tier Super Headers**: Implemented a dynamic "Internal Assessment" umbrella header that perfectly groups Term 1, Written, and Project work.
* **Surgical Column Removal**: Optimized the register layout by permanently deleting legacy weightage and grand total columns (L, P, T, U).
* **A4 Print Optimization**: 
    * Bumped base font size to **10pt** for physical readability.
    * Matched vertical and horizontal header sizes for visual symmetry.
    * Forced **Bold Black Ink** for Pass/Fail results to ensure high-contrast printing.
* **Bulk Export Logic**: Patched the class selection array to properly iterate through ALL classes `1` through `8` during multi-sheet Excel generation.

### 🛠️ Stability & Security
* **Spooler Protection**: Eliminated the print race condition by using `requestAnimationFrame` to verify the DOM has painted before opening the system spooler.
* **Excel Grid Alignment**: Added 2 metadata rows at the top of spreadsheets and adjusted header-style offsets for flawless MS Office and WPS compatibility.

# 📜 Changelog
## [v5.0] - 2026-03-13
### 🚀 Major Architectural Upgrades
* **Decoupled Print Engine:** Transitioned from a single-file system to a high-performance **Two-File Architecture** (`index.html` + `print.html`) to bypass mobile browser security restrictions.
* **Pure-Payload Delivery:** Developed a "Bridge" system that transfers raw data from the main app to a dedicated print tab via `localStorage`, ensuring 100% data integrity without server dependencies.
* **Static Snapshot Downloader:** The "Download HTML" feature now generates a pure, script-free HTML file, preventing "No Data Found" errors when opened from local device storage.
* **Named-Tab Navigation:** Implemented a synchronous tab-reusage strategy to prevent local server freezes and bypass aggressive mobile pop-up blockers.

### 💎 User Interface & Experience (UX)
* **Glassmorphic Info System:** 
* **Scroll-Lock Synchronization:** 
* **Safety Exit (X-Close):**

### 🖨️ Printing & Export Optimizations
* **Rigid Table Architecture:** Implemented `table-layout: fixed` and explicit mathematical column widths to solve the "Chopped Column" bug on Android print spoolers.
* **Repeated Header Logic:** Engineered CSS `table-header-group` rules to ensure school headings and subject labels repeat automatically on every page of a multi-page printed report.
* **1-Second Rapid Spooling:** Optimized the font-loading delay from 3 seconds to 1 second for a faster, more responsive export workflow.
* **PC-Optimized Excel:** Refined the `.xlsx` engine to include hardcoded landscape formatting and signature blocks for perfect "One-Click" printing on computers.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
* **Resolved:** Fixed the "Loading..." hang on mobile browsers by switching to a synchronous named-tab navigation strategy.
* **Corrected:** Fixed a critical string concatenation error (`${payload}`) that caused the HTML downloader to fail in certain mobile environments.
* **Cleaned:** Removed duplicate script execution in the print engine that caused potential browser crashes on low-RAM devices.
* **Optimized:** Fixed viewport scaling issues that caused headers and signatures to misalign on mobile screens.



## [v4.6] - 2026-02-17
### **Rebranding & Identity**
* **New Official Name**: Rebranded to **Assess Offline: Digital CCE Register** to align with government educational standards.
* **School-Compliant PDF Headers**: Integrated the formal Odia title **"ନିରନ୍ତର ଓ ବ୍ୟାପକ ଆକଳନ ଫର୍ଦ୍ଦ"** (Continuous & Comprehensive Assessment Sheet) for official school records.
* **Dynamic Title Engine**: Updated the translation object (`TR`) to automatically switch report titles between English and Odia based on user settings.

### **Architectural Upgrades**
* **Split Limits Tiering**: Introduced independent Max Mark configurations for **Primary (Class 1-5)** and **Upper Primary (Class 6-8)**.

* **Safe Schema Hydration**: Implemented intelligent database booting in `init()` to silently patch old save files with new Upper Primary limit keys without risking user data loss.
  
* **Legacy Data Clamping**: Modified the math engine and PDF generator to use strict `Math.min()` clamping, ensuring that legacy marks from v4.5 do not exceed new v4.6 limits in grand total calculations.

### **PDF & Print Engine Fixes**
* **Bottom-to-Top Headers**: Re-engineered vertical table headers to read from bottom-to-top using a 180-degree rotation, matching traditional physical registers.
  
* **Layout Stability**: Fixed the CSS for vertical text (`.v-txt`) by removing absolute positioning to prevent table cell collapse during browser-side PDF generation.
  
* **NaN Protection**: Added division-by-zero safeguards (`maxT1 > 0 ? ... : 0`) to prevent "NaN" errors in grand totals for non-exam classes.
  
* **Absentee Rendering**: Updated the `pM` (Safe Render) function to correctly display the "-" (Absent) flag on printed reports.

### **UI/UX & Mobile Optimization**
* **Compact Label Hack**: Applied a `-0.5px` letter-spacing constraint to UI labels, allowing full text for **"Assignment 1"** and **"Project 1"** without causing "..." truncation on narrow mobile screens.
* **Drawer Animation Lock**: Resolved a race condition in `toggleDrawer()` using a global `clearTimeout` variable, preventing background interaction while the menu is transitioning.
* **Touch-Tap Protection**: Disabled native OS text selection on the developer pill via CSS (`user-select: none`) to prevent accidental Google Search popups during rapid log tapping.
* **Validation Hardening**: Strengthened `checkComp` logic to detect and block malformed data (such as standalone decimal points) that previously caused silent math failures.

### **Data Management**
* **Anchor Sorting for Backups**: Prepended the `!` symbol to JSON backup filenames to ensure they always appear at the absolute top of the user's download list regardless of sort order.
* **Log System Rebranding**: Updated internal black-box logging to reflect the new **Digital CCE Register** identity for easier troubleshooting.

### 🚀 Changelog: v4.5 (The "Fortress" Update)
*This update brings an elite-level architectural overhaul, resolving deep mobile OS bottlenecks and securing the UI physics.*

### 🛠️ Elite Engineering & Mobile Bypasses
* **Android Back-Button Trap:** Implemented a custom `window.history.pushState` router. Pressing the physical back button now safely closes active modals instead of killing the browser tab.
* **XSS Layout Armor:** Deep string sanitization injected into all UI rendering loops and PDF/Excel export engines. Malicious input strings can no longer shatter the table layouts.
* **Native OS Routing Security:** Bypassed aggressive Android/iOS anti-malware pop-up blockers by migrating the "Restore Data" trigger to a native HTML `<label>` node.
* **iOS Safari Scroll Lock:** Added native `ontouchmove="event.preventDefault()"` to overlay backgrounds to stop iPhones from "rubber-banding" behind Glass modals.

### ⚡ UX & Input Speed Hacks
* **The "Double-Dot" Speed Hack:** Tapping `..` on a mobile numeric keypad instantly transforms into a `-` (Absent). The math engine safely parses this as a 0, preventing `NaN` calculation crashes.
* **Singleton Notification Engine:** Re-architected notifications into a strict Singleton DOM node to prevent invisible ghost elements from stacking in the DOM.
* **Smart Auto-Focus:** Opening the "Add Student" modal instantly triggers the hardware keyboard and focuses the cursor, eliminating repetitive screen tapping.

### 📊 Structural Math Upgrades
* **Class 8 Autonomy:** Class 8 has been surgically separated into an independent database tier to accommodate its unique subject count.
* **Elective Merge:** Hindi and Sanskrit are now elegantly merged into a single `"Hindi / Sanskrit"` column, permanently resolving validation errors for the 3rd language elective.
* **Smart Migration Engine:** The boot sequence automatically detects missing Class 8 databases in older save files and safely clones existing customizations instead of overwriting them with defaults.
  
### **v4.1 (Final Stable) - *The Golden Master***
> *Released: Feb 2026*
* **✨ UI:** Implemented "Tetris Grid" logic—`SA-2` box now spans 2 columns.
* **🛡️ Security:** Added `sanitize()` function to prevent XSS attacks.
* **🐛 Fix:** `restoreData` now runs a "Sanity Loop" before saving, preventing crashes.
* **💅 Polish:** Reduced input padding for a high-density, professional look.

### **v4.0**
* **🔧 Feature:** Restored "Weightage %" editing in Settings (Group B).
* **⚖️ Legal:** Added Non-Govt Disclaimer & MIT License.
* **📄 Export:** Added Smart PDF Filename generation (e.g., `All class (2025-26)...`).

### **v3.2**
* **💾 Core:** Fixed Android File Picker (`MIME type */*`) issue.
* **🌐 Encoding:** Added `\uFEFF` BOM for Excel compatibility.
